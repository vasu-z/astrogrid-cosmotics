## 🧬 Features Breakdown

| Feature                     | Description                                                          |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧠 Genetic Algorithm (GA)   | Optimized 3D cargo placement based on weight, priority, expiry, size |
| 🧲 Obstruction Logic        | Retrieves items by intelligently removing blockers                   |
| 🔎 Smart Flashlight Scanner | AR Camera + Priority Glow + Expiry Alerts                            |
| ⚙️ Gravity-Based Sorting    | Heavy items sink, light/critical items float on top                  |
| 🟡 Expiry Glow Stickers     | Items glow yellow/red when expired or near expiry                    |
| 📊 Real-Time Grid Tracking  | Volume-based grid visualization of cargo layout                      |
| 🚨 Beep on Expiry Detection | Audible alert when scanning expired or expiring items                |
